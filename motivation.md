# Motivation

Hey, my name is [Tristan](https://github.com/firsttris) I'm a web developer and [Clean Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjhX2sVf0eg) advocate.

I have worked on single page applications for [several companies](https://firsttris.github.io/gatsby-cv/) and I have seen many projects fail, choosing complex state management solutions before they really needed it.

Don't worry! At some point we all fell for it, until we saw other people [questioning](https://youtu.be/Q54YDGC_t3Y?t=357) this approach.

In every new project I had to explain all over why it is not a good idea to design everything in the application with Redux. I created this Gitbook to share my opinion on state management with you.

Please take my opinion with a grain of salt, I learned that there is more than one way to skin a cat.

Im always reffering to React, but this also applies for Vue, Angular or similar reactive frameworks.
