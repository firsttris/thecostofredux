# Motivation

Hey, I'm [Tristan](https://github.com/firsttris) a software engineer and [clean code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjhX2sVf0eg) advocate.

I have worked on single page applications for [several companies](https://firsttris.github.io/gatsby-cv/) and I have seen many projects fail, choosing complex state management solutions before they really needed it.

At some point I was really tired since in every new project I had to explain all over why it is not a good idea to design everything in the application with Redux. I created this Gitbook to share my opinion on state management with you.

Don't worry! At some point we all fell for it, until we saw other people [questioning](https://youtu.be/Q54YDGC_t3Y?t=357) this approach.

Please take my opinion with a grain of salt, as there is more than one way to skin a cat.

While the most information you find online is more dedicated to the postive side of Redux, is my Gitbook more focused on the dark side of Redux. 

I'm always referring to React, but this also applies for Vue, Angular or similar reactive frameworks.

Please excuse any mistakes, I was never really good in languages, it's hard for me to write something without a compiler.
