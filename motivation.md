# Motivation

Hey I'm Tristan a JavaScript Developer and [Clean Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjhX2sVf0eg) advocate.

I have worked on single page application for [several big companies](https://firsttris.github.io/gatsby-cv/) and wanted to share my experience on state management in reactive apps with you.

I have seen many projects fail, choosing complex state management solutions before they really need it.

Don't worry at some point i also fell for it, till I saw others [questioning it](https://youtu.be/Q54YDGC_t3Y?t=357). 

Since in every project I had to start again and again explaining why it is not a good idea to design everything in the application with redux, I wrote it down. So I can just send this link to the people.

Please take my opinion with a grain of salt, other developers have other opinions and I respect that.
