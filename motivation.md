# Motivation

Hey, I'm [Tristan](https://github.com/firsttris) a software engineer and [clean code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjhX2sVf0eg) advocate.

I have worked on single page applications for [several companies](https://firsttris.github.io/gatsby-cv/) and I have seen many projects fail, choosing complex state management solutions before they really needed it.

At some point I was really tired to explain why it is not a good idea to design everything in the application with Redux. So I created this Gitbook to share my opinion on state management with you.

Don't worry! At some point we all fell for it, until we saw other people [questioning](https://youtu.be/Q54YDGC_t3Y?t=357) this approach.

Please take my opinion with a grain of salt, as there is more than one way to skin a cat.

While most information you find online is mostly highlighting to the postive side of Redux, my Gitbook is focused on the dark side of Redux. 

I'm always referring to React and Redux, but this also applies for similar reactive frameworks and the Flux architecture.

Please excuse any mistakes, I was never really good in languages, it's hard for me to write something without a compiler.
