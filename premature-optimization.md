# Premature optimization is the root of all evil

You should not think about stuff like **performance, caching, global state management** when starting an application.

_“The real problem is that programmers have spent far too much time worrying about efficiency in the wrong places and at the wrong times; premature optimization is the root of all evil \(or at least most of it\) in programming.”_

Isn't good not good enough?
