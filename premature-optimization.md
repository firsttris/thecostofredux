# Premature optimization is the root of all evil

You should not think about premature optimization \(performance, caching, state management\) ****when starting an application. Programmers spend far too much time worrying about efficiency in the wrong places and at the wrong times. This introduces new unexpected bugs and can be a huge time waster.

Ask yourself, isn't good not good enough?
