# Premature optimization is the root of all evil

You should not think about stuff like **performance, caching, global state management** when starting an application.

_“The real problem is that programmers have spent far too much time worrying about efficiency in the wrong places and at the wrong times; premature optimization is the root of all evil \(or at least most of it\) in programming.”_

\_\_[_Donalt Knuth_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth)\_\_

The biggest problems with "premature optimization" are that it can introduce new unexpected bugs and can be a huge time waster.

Isn't good not good enough?
