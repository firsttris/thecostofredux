# Why do people choose Redux before they need it?

Think about it like this:

Imagine everything on amazon is free. You would try to get as much cool stuff as possible without thinking what you really need. 

It is similar for developers with shiny tools. They want all the cool stuff in their project without considering the possible downsides.

But I think there are other reasons as well, educational. Being a developer means you always have to learn new things. You don't want to get left behind. How else can you say of yourself that you are a professional in Redux?

Another reason might be that most React developers are rather young and most likely just started a tutorial pointing in the direction, that this would be the best practice for a good structured React App.

Here are some other reasons I heard in projects over the years:

* They think its structuring their application better, but React in general is structured very well.
* They think it doesn't scale without it, but most often it doesn't scale with Redux.
* They think its the best practice for React, but its not.
* They think they might need it in the future, but they don't.
* They think they need it for caching, but they didn't even think about cache invalidation.
* They think they can better trace their state changes, but big stores are often more confusing than local state changes.
* They think its easier for the developers to always create the sames files, but without Redux they wouldn't even have to create those files.
