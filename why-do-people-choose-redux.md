# Why do people choose Redux before they need it?

Think about it like this:

Imagine everything in the supermarket is free. You would try to get as much stuff as possible without thinking what you really need. 

It is similar for developers with dependencies. They want all the shiny fancy tools in their project without considering the possible downsides.

But I think there are other reasons, they want to learn them. How else can you say of yourself that you are a professional in Redux?

Here are some other reasons I heard from people over the years:

* They think its structuring their application better, but React in general is structured very well.
* They think it doesn't scale without it, but most often it doesn't scale with Redux.
* They think its the best practice for React, but its not.
* They think they might need it in the future, but they don't.
* They think they need it for caching, but they didn't even think about cache invalidation.
* They think they can better trace their state changes, but big stores are often more confusing than local state changes.
