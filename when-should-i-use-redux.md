# When should i use Redux?

* You have reasonable amounts of data changing over time
* You need a single source of truth for your state
* You find that keeping all your state in a top-level component is no longer sufficient

**Dan Abramov**: I would like to amend this: **don't use Redux until you have problems with vanilla react.**

**Pete Hunt**: You'll know when you need Flux. **If you aren't sure if you need it, you don't need it.**
