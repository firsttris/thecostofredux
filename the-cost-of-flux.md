# The Cost of Redux

* Up to 30-50% more code
* Todo simple things you have to create many files
* More code causes more errors which needs more tests
* Harder to follow the flow of the application \(you need to understand many files\)
* You potentially introduce new problems like “stale data”
* Application will be slow on older devices \(more code for the browser\)
* More dependencies \( depending 10-20+ \)
* Creating new features is more expensive
* Introducing new developers is more expensive
* Harder to refactor \(~5 years\)
