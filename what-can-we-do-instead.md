description: Build micro frontends instead of monolithic frontends

# What can we do instead?

### On the Backend Side

* Put as much business logic in your backend.
* Put as much transformation and mapping logic in your backend.
* If possible you could implement [projection](https://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-sparse-fieldsets) and [selection](https://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-filtering) in your REST services.

### On the Client Side

* Always start without Redux or any other state management solution.
* Create one class which contains your API calls.
* Do your [Fetch](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-ajax.html) calls in componentDidMount\(\) or UseEffect\(\) and hold the state in the component \(Smart Component\).
* Try to use [Component Composition](https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html) to reverse the flow of control whenever needed.
* You can persist information in the URI, and it will always be the better way, simply because http is stateless.
* You can use Singletons \(HoCâ€˜s\) which are on the Router level or above \(e.g. for Security ProtectedRoutes\).



And if there really is no way around it you could still use

* React Context
* useReducer\(\) hook
